# WordPress parent theme
For my most recent WordPress projects, I've developed a parent theme with some basic framework features, which I update on a regular basis. I've decided to make it public, so here you go :)
This repo is provided 'as is', so only use it if you know what you're doing :)

## Installation

1. Click on the `Download ZIP` button at the right to download the plugin.
2. Upload the entire `wp-parent-theme` folder to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory.
3. Navigate to the `Appearance` menu in WordPress.
4. Activate `Parent Theme` from the list of themes in right screen.
